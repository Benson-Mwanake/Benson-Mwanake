# 👋🏾 Hey, I'm Benson!
I'm a software engineer, creative builder, and future tech founder who’s passionate about using code to solve real-world problems. From designing sleek UIs to building full-stack applications, I love turning ideas into digital experiences that are practical, clean, and impactful.

My journey started with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — and now I’m deep in the world of React, Python (Flask), Tailwind, and APIs. Alongside building apps.

Whether it’s launching my own startup, contributing to tech communities, or sharing the process of learning and building, I believe in growing through experimentation, persistence, and making every step count.

### ✨ My Three Pillars: Build, Learn, Become

💻 **Build** – I create scalable full-stack web applications with clean, expressive UI/UX.  
📚 **Learn** – Always experimenting, improving, and staying curious about the craft of software.  
🚀 **Become** – On a mission to become a world-class engineer, creative entrepreneur, and mentor to the next wave.

### 💫 What I Like to Do

- 🔧 **Engineer real solutions** – I enjoy solving everyday problems with purposeful apps like repair service platforms, productivity tools, and more.  
- 🎨 **Design with flair** – I love making interfaces that feel clean and human. Aesthetics matter.  
- 🧠 **Build community** – I want to create spaces (online or offline) where people feel encouraged, seen, and supported.
