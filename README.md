# 👋🏾 Hey, I'm Benson!
I'm a software engineer, creative builder, and future tech founder who’s passionate about using code to solve real-world problems. From designing sleek UIs to building full-stack applications, I love turning ideas into digital experiences that are practical, clean, and impactful.

My journey started with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — and now I’m deep in the world of React, Python (Flask), Tailwind, and APIs. Alongside building apps.

Whether it’s launching my own startup (**TengenezaNow**), contributing to tech communities, or sharing the process of learning and building, I believe in growing through experimentation, persistence, and making every step count.

### ✨ My Three Pillars: Build, Learn, Become

💻 **Build** – I create scalable full-stack web applications with clean, expressive UI/UX.  
📚 **Learn** – Always experimenting, improving, and staying curious about the craft of software.  
🚀 **Become** – On a mission to become a world-class engineer, creative entrepreneur, and mentor to the next wave.

### 💫 What I Like to Do

- 🔧 **Engineer real solutions** – I enjoy solving everyday problems with purposeful apps like repair service platforms, productivity tools, and more.  
- 🎨 **Design with flair** – I love making interfaces that feel clean and human. Aesthetics matter.  
- 🧠 **Build community** – I want to create spaces (online or offline) where people feel encouraged, seen, and supported.
